Adequacy of taxation provisions  We challenged and applied professional scepticism to tax exposures estimated by management and the risk analysis associated with these exposures along with claims or assessments made by tax authorities to date. We performed audit procedures on the calculation and disclosure of deferred tax to assess compliance with local tax rules and the group's accounting policies including the impact of \",\"  involved in determining the provision for tax liabilities, can result in misstatement of provisions; and  XXthere are a range of possible transfer prices, therefore there is a risk of challenge by the tax authorities, particularly with the increased focus on tax and multinational businesses. We challenged and applied professional scepticism to tax exposures estimated by management and the risk analysis associated with these exposures along with claims or assessments made by tax authorities to date. We have audited the components of the tax risk provision to ensure they reflect the tax risks in the business and that the provisions are appropriate in the circumstances. We have also reviewed documentation in relation to tax audits to ensure that any exposures the tax authorities are \",\"  businesses. As the forecasts, and what period can reliably be forecasted are inherently judgemental this is an area we focus on.

We focus on the recognition of certain deferred  tax assets and assets relating\",\"of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.

Tax accruals  Audit risk    Accruals for tax contingencies require the   directors to make judgements and estimates   in\\\\xA0relation to tax risks. This is one of the key   judgemental areas that our audit is   concentrated on due to the Group operating   in a number of tax jurisdictions and the   complexities of international tax legislation.   The tax matters are at various stages, from   preliminary discussions with tax authorities   through to tax tribunal or court proceedings   where the matters can take many years to   resolve. The risk to the f?nancial statements   is that the eventual resolution of a matter   with tax authorities is at an amount materially   different to the estimated accrual.   Procedures to address these audit risks   included those listed below  Together with our own tax specialists, we   considered any large or unusual items in the   effective tax reconciliation and whether or   not these current year items would indicate   a\\\\xA0requirement for further accruals.    In considering the judgements and estimates   of tax accruals, we used our own international   and local tax specialists to assess the   Group\\\\x92s tax\",\"tax expense in a way that is   consistent with its values and its legal obligations   in\\\\xA0all\\\\xA0relevant jurisdictions.   The Group promotes collaborative professional working   with tax authorities in order to build open, transparent   and\\\\xA0trusted relationships. As part of this, the Group   engages in open and early dialogue to discuss tax   planning, strategy, risks and signi?cant transactions,   and\\\\xA0discloses any signi?cant uncertainties in relation to   tax\\\\xA0matters. Queries and information requests by tax   authorities are responded to in a timely fashion and the   Group ensures that tax authorities are kept informed   about\\\\xA0how issues are progressing.

Tax The Director of Tax and Treasury presented a report to the Committee at the February and July meetings, explained  the basis of the Group\\\\x92s tax position, identi?ed key taxation risks to the Group and updated the Committee on the  ongoing relationship with HMRC.

Taxation   Refer to pages 62 to 64 (Audit Committee Report), pages 102 to 106  (Principal Accounting Policies) and pages 102 to 142 (Notes to   the accounts)  Tax is a specific risk for the Group due to the degree of judgement  involved in some of the ongoing activities of the Group and the wider  Group restructuring. This gives rise to material tax considerations on the  calculation, recognition, and classification of current and deferred tax  balances from both a tax compliance and accounting perspective.    Judgements are made by management to arrive at the current and  deferred tax position. These\",\"  local trading are significant. Therefore, normally no separate value for  customer agreements will be recognised in these cases, as customer rela- tions are closely associated with the value of the acquired trademarks. Measurement is based on expected future cash flows for the customer  agreements on the basis of key assumptions about sales growth, operating  margin, customer retention rate and theoretically calculated tax and contri- butions to other assets. A post-tax discount rate is used which reflects the  risk-free interest rate with the addition of specific and future risks associated  with the customer agreements. Impairment test.  In performing the annual impairment test of goodwill, an  assessment is made as to whether the individual units of the entity (cash- generating units) to which goodwill relates will be able to generate sufficient  positive net cash flows in the future to support the \",\"specific regulations,  especially in France, concerning the Casino Group\\\\x92s bank (Banque  Casino \\\\x96 bank and consumer credit institution), Cdiscount  (e-commerce), Sud\\\\xE9co (real estate agent), Flor\\\\xE9al and Casino    Carburants (service stations), L\\\\x92Immobili\\\\xE8re Groupe Casino and  Green Yellow (photovoltaic energy production). The Group has implemented the necessary legal structures and  processes at the appropriate levels to ensure compliance with  these regulations.   Tax and customs risks   The Group is required to comply with the rules applicable in  its various host countries to the business sectors of its various  entities. The Group Tax department and the tax departments of  the various entities are responsible for identifying, controlling  and monitoring tax-related risk. The Group is subject to periodical tax inspections in France and  in the various countries where it operates. The Group recognises  provisions for all accepted tax assessment adjustments, while  contested adjustments are recognised on a case-by-case basis  according to estimates that factor in the risk of an unfavourable  outcome to any claims and appeals.

Whilst we  endeavour to manage our tax affairs in  an ef?  cient manner, due to an ever more   complex international tax environment  there will always be a level of  uncertainty when provisioning for our  tax liabilities.

Risks from guarantees, legal and tax risks    The Group continues to be exposed to risks from guarantees  and legal risks. Provisions are recognized for those risks if and  insofar as that they are likely to be utilized and the amounts   of the obligations can be reasonably estimated. In 2015, the risk  and opportunity management system was expanded to include  tax risks. No quantitative assessment of tax risks is carried out.  Risks from guarantees  Issuing guarantees results in liability risks for the Group.   For example, Daimler holds an equity interest in the system   for recording and charging tolls for the use of highways in   Germany by commercial vehicles.

Revenue Recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers net of value added tax, rebates and  discounts. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are  transferred to the buyer, which generally arises on delivery, or in accordance with specific terms and conditions agreed with  customers. Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised in the period in which the services are rendered.  Interest income is accrued\",\"  the Executive Board and the management teams of each division.

Tax issues are regularly analyzed and assessed by the central tax department in cooperation with  third-party tax consultants. Tax risks are possible for all outstanding assessment periods. Appro- priate provisions have been recognized in the past for tax risks already known about. Beyond this,  the management is not aware of any speci?c risks in addition to the general tax audit risk that could  have a negative impact on the planned earnings development of the Group. Risks relating to personnel arise mainly from shortages of potential staff in the recruitment process,  a lack of \",\", net   assets and the ?nancial position, but the HUGO BOSS Group regards this impact as minor.

Consequently, the Compagnie Plastic Omnium has put into place a  Tax Department, which works in close collaboration with the  Accounting, Legal, and Finance Departments.

Changes in  taxation legislation and rates may impact the Group\\\\x92s net  earnings and cash flows.   The Group works closely with its tax advisers to review its  tax position, undertake periodic tax audits and monitor any  changes in tax legislation.   Competitive landscape   Risk Mitigation  The gambling industry is extremely competitive and so is the  related software and services industry that supports it. Failure  to compete effectively may result in the loss of licensees and  also the inability to attract new licensees.   The Group continues to invest significant resources  in research\",\"seeks to ensure that  evolving tax rules and practices are carefully considered  in advance of actual enactment and implementation  of changing laws and practices which, together with  ensuring that appropriate discipline is strictly adhered to,  minimises the risk that potentially adverse consequences will  significantly impact the Group\\\\x92s underlying effective tax rate.

In respect of tax contingencies, the challenge from the Committee  focused on the extent and strength of professional advice received  from external legal and advisory firms. In relation to the public and political environment, the Committee  required management to manage taxes transparently and with due  regard to commercial and reputational risks.  In relation to the recognition of the deferred tax assets, the Committee  challenged management\\\\x92s expectations for future taxable profits. The statutory auditor also identified this as an area of higher audit risk  and the Committee received reporting from them on these matters.

If timing is significant, the size of the provision is  based on the expected future cash flows discounted at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current  market rate of interest as well as the specific risks associated with the liabilities.

Revenue from long-term contracts and  long-term \",\". We take a conservative approach to all tax planning with  the overarching aim of paying the right amount of tax at  the right time in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.  We operate in a complex global environment doing business  in and between many countries. This complexity and the  variability of our tax obligations, across a range of different  tax jurisdictions, present risks which require to be managed.  A principal tax risk faced by the Group arises as a result   of uncertainty regarding the acceptance of the Group\\\\x92s  intragroup transaction pricing policies by tax authorities  around the world. This risk is mitigated by management  through (i) ensuring compliance with local transfer pricing  legislation in each relevant jurisdiction; (ii) proactive liaison  with tax authorities; and (iii) the involvement of external tax  advisers in the identification and management of pricing  policies and related documentation.    Another principal risk arises from the uncertainty created  by the changing international tax landscape which may  impact our financing arrangements going forward. While  anticipated changes to the tax environment are not yet  finalised, we continue to actively monitor this as part of  our tax risk management. Our decisions in relation to tax  are governed by the Group\\\\x92s risk appetite statement which  sets out the risk assertions and the parameters within  which we operate. We also face the inherent risk that we  fail to meet our compliance obligations given the size and  diversity of the Group. The Group mitigates the risk of  failure to meet our tax obligations through the application  of a series of policies and procedures, defined roles and  responsibilities and delegated authority matrices.  The risk that the application of management judgements  and estimates in tax provisioning in the financial  statements fails to present a true and fair view of the tax  position is a risk which receives significant focus from  management, tax advisers and auditors. Actions to  mitigate include the following:  \\\\x96 local reporting entities prepare tax provisions and  balances in accordance with Group Accounting Policy;  \\\\x96 procedures are in place to escalate issues to Group  level and the Group tax team is involved in the  progression and completion of tax audits;  \\\\x96 tax data\",\"-going  enquiries and tax audits with local tax authorities; (ii) the Group\\\\x92s effective tax rate for the current year; and (iii) the level of provisioning for known and potential  liabilities, including significant movements on the prior period. In addition, the Committee takes comfort from the presentation to the main Board on tax  strategy and risk, given by the Group Head of Tax, every year. A summary of the Group\\\\x92s tax policy is provided in the Financial Review on page 46. In light of  the continued focus on tax transparency, we have specifically considered the disclosures in the Financial Review and in note 7, in particular the narrative  in respect of the reconciliation of tax, sustainability of the effective tax rate and the processes in place, designed to manage tax risk and uncertain tax positions.  Based on the work we have undertaken, we are satisfied that the position presented in these financial statements is appropriate and understandable.

A decline in  the euro compared with the major currencies would have led to a similar increase in equity and profit after tax.

The accounting for post-employment benefit   plans is based on annual actuarial calculations.   59      Risk description and impact Mitigation   Taxes   Changes in operational taxes and corporate income tax   rates, laws and regulations could adversely affect the   company\\\\x92s financial results, tax assets and liabilities.   Most taxes are transactional and employee-related and   are levied from the legal entities in the relevant   jurisdictions.    Wolters Kluwer maintains a liability for certain   contingencies in line with IFRS accounting standards.   The adequacy of this liability is judged on a regular   basis in consultation with external advisors. Reference   is made to note 20 of the Consolidated Financial   Statements for additional information about corporate   income tax and related risks.   As leader in Tax & Accounting products, the company   takes its responsibility as a corporate citizen seriously.   This has been confirmed in the Tax Principles which the   company has published on its website.
